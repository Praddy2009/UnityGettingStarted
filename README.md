# UnityGettingStarted 
## By [Praddyum Verma]("https://praddy2009.github.io/portfolio/") 

Here We'll try to compile the day wise learning for [Unity](https://unity.com/) with an aim to learn [ARFoundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@2.2/manual/index.html). Point to note is that we will be just covering the parts that will help us accomplish our aim.

We'll divide our module as:

- [X] [Installing Unity & dependencies](Installing/README.md)
- [X] [Understanding Interface](Interface/README.md)
- [X] [Understanding UI elements](UI/README.md)
- [ ] [Let's See Sharp(C#)](C#/README.md) 
- [ ] [Exploring AR persepective]()

A big shoutout to [XoRphilic]() for introducing me to the world of Augmented Reality and all the content creators for the superawesome free contents.
