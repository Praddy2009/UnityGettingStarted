## Installing Unity and Dependencies

First of all we need to setup the infrastructure and other necessary dependencies for smooth running of Unity.

> Installing Unity Hub

1. **Download Unity Hub**[(https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)].

   You can consider Unity Hub as the one stop portal for downloading Unity with it's dependencies.

2. **Activating Lisense**
   
   After installation of Unity hub it's time to activate lisence. For the development process we have to add a lisense of Unity to Unity hub.

   Step 1. Activate new license

3. **Download Unity lts(long term support) version.**
   
   After installing Unity hub on your machine it's time to install Unity and other dependencies. We should always install **lts** version as it provides the support for next 5 years from the year of it's release. In my case I'll be installing 2019.4.20f1.

   Step 1. Visit Installs panel and ADD

   Step 4. Accept the user agreement and done.

4. **Installing VSCode as our code editor.**

   You can also install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) as it's the official code editor for Unity. But since I'm running on Linux Visual Studio is not present for that platform.
